## 💡 My Project Idea | 我的项目想法

### Project Name (if you have one) | 项目名称（如果你有的话）

Heart Island

### What do I want to make? | 我想做什么？

I want to create an AI-powered communication practice platform that helps people improve their relationships through simulated dialogues. The platform will provide scenarios for parent-child, partner, and workplace conversations. Users can practice expressing themselves while receiving real-time feedback on their communication style. It will suggest better ways to convey thoughts and emotions effectively.

### Why do I want to make this? | 为什么想做这个？

It solves the problem of miscommunication in relationships where people care about each other but struggle to express themselves properly. I'm excited about using technology to facilitate deeper human connections and prevent unnecessary conflicts. The potential to help people build healthier relationships through better communication really inspires me.

### What technologies or tools might I need? | 我可能需要什么技术或工具？
